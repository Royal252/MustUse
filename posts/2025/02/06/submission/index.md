# 🔍 Initial Analysis

## First Steps
> Initially, the website appears as follows:
> 
> ![Site Presentation](/images/x3CTF-2025/Submission/site_presentation.png "Site Presentation")
>
> There is a file upload section where only `.txt` files can be uploaded. Reading the attached files, there was only a PHP file:
> 
> ```php
> 
> if (isset($_FILES['file'])) {
>	$uploadOk = 1;
>	$target_dir = "/var/www/html/uploads/";
>	$target_file = $target_dir . basename($_FILES["file"]["name"]);  
>
>if (file_exists($target_file)) {
>  echo "Sorry, file already exists.";
>  $uploadOk = 0;
>}
>
>if ($_FILES["file"]["size"] > 50000) {
>  echo "Sorry, your file is too large you need to buy Nitro.";
>  $uploadOk = 0;
>}
>if (!str_ends_with($target_file, '.txt')) {
>  echo "Due to exploit you can only upload files with .txt extensions sorry about this but we got hacked last time so we have to check this from now on.";
>  $uploadOk = 0;
>}
>// Check if $uploadOk is set to 0 by an error
>if ($uploadOk == 0) {
>  echo "Sorry, your file was not uploaded.";
>// if everything is ok, try to upload file
>} else {
>  if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES["file"]["tmp_name"], $target_file)) {
>    echo "The file ". htmlspecialchars( basename( $_FILES["file"]["name"])). " has been uploaded.";
>  } else {
>    echo "Sorry, there was an error uploading your file.";
>  }
>}
>
>$old_path = getcwd();
>chdir($target_dir);
>// make unreadable
>shell_exec('chmod 000 *');
>chdir($old_path);
>}
> ```

> As we can see, the files are uploaded to the `/uploads` folder, followed by various checks, including one on the file size and another on the extension, which must always end with `.txt`. Initially, I thought of uploading a malicious PHP file to read `flag.txt`, which was located under the `uploads` folder, since trying to access `/uploads/flag.txt` returned `403 Forbidden`. I attempted to bypass the extension check with a null byte, using `exploit.php%00.txt`, but it didn’t work. Searching online, I found another type of attack that allowed command execution through the `.htaccess` file. Interestingly, when I tried uploading a file starting with `.`, I was able to read it using the `/uploads/filename` route (but I quickly realized why). As we can see, a `chmod 000 *` command is executed right after the upload, setting all permissions to null for every file in the `uploads` folder. This was why accessing files through the browser returned `403 Forbidden`. It is also the reason why I was able to read the files I uploaded with a `.` at the beginning of the name. The `chmod ... *` command affects all visible files but doesn’t include hidden files (those starting with `.` or special characters, such as `-`). Since their permissions weren’t nullified, I could still access them. From there, I did some research to better understand how `chmod` works and realized it was an issue of insecure file permissions. Now, let's move on to the exploit.

## 🔬 Vulnerability Analysis
### Potential Vulnerabilities
>- [x] Insecure File Permission

# 🎯 Solution Path

## Exploitation Steps
### Initial setup
> After doing some research, I discovered that there is a specific flag that can be used with the `chmod` command, `--reference=filename file`, which allows you to set the permissions of the target file (passed as an argument) to match those of the reference file (like a copy-and-paste of permissions). So, I decided to exploit this flag, given that `chmod` was being applied to `*` (a wildcard indicating "all"). By setting the permissions of all files in the folder, I thought of using this to my advantage.
>
### Exploitation
> The exploitation essentially relies on uploading a file named `--reference=foo.txt`, for example (since there is always an extension check):
>   
>   ![First Part](/images/x3CTF-2025/Submission/reference.png "First Part")
>   
> Once the upload is done, `chmod` is called, and all the permissions are set to null. However, the exploit doesn't stop there. In fact, for the reference flag, you need to specify a file, as we mentioned, `foo.txt`, so I uploaded that file as well:
>   
>   ![Second Part](/images/x3CTF-2025/Submission/foo_upload.png "Second Part")
>   
> Once the file is uploaded, `chmod` will be executed on all the files, and as soon as it reaches the file `--reference=foo.txt`, it will treat it as a flag in the execution of the command. This will set the permissions of all files in the folder to match those of the `foo.txt` file (which, being the last one uploaded, still has active read permissions because `chmod` hasn’t been executed on it yet). As a result, the read permission for the `flag.txt` file will also be set, and by accessing the `/uploads/flag.txt` route, I was able to read the flag.

# 🛠️ Exploitation Process
## Approach
> The exploit does exactly as described manually: it uses the `--reference` flag of `chmod` to apply the permissions of the `foo.txt` file to all the files, including `flag.txt`, and then retrieves the flag by accessing the `/uploads/flag.txt` route.

# 💡 Key Learnings
## New Knowledge
> I learned that `chmod` ignores hidden files (those named with `.something` or files starting with `-`). I also learned that when the `--reference=filename file` parameter is used, it sets the permissions of the target file to match those of the file specified as the reference.
