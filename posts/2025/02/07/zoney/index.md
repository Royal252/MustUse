## 📝 Challenge Information
>Are you ZONEy.eno out or can you find the flag? 52.59.124.14:5007 (UDP)

# 🔍 Initial Analysis

## First Steps
> The challenge provides:
> 
> `52.59.124.14:5007 (UDP)`
>
> Doing an nmap scan, I discovered that there is a DNS (Domain Name System) server on port 5007, so I used dig (a DNS lookup tool) on the specified IP and port. Since the name of the challenge itself, ZONEy, is somewhat reminiscent of zone (zone transfer in DNS), I thought it could be related to that:
>
> ```bash
> dig @52.59.124.14 -p 5007 MX zoney.eno +short
> ```
>
> This command looks for the **Mail Exchange (MX) record** for `zoney.eno`. The result:
>
> `10 challenge.zoney.eno.`
>
> The result suggests that `challenge.zoney.eno` is a domain to explore further. So, searching online, I found the DNSSEC NSEC Walking vulnerability, which is used to enumerate subdomains of a network by making requests to the DNS server. **DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions)** is an extension of DNS that provides **authenticity and integrity** to DNS records, preventing attacks like **DNS Spoofing**. DNSSEC introduces new records such as **RRSIG, NSEC, and DS** to ensure the validity of DNS responses. **NSEC (Next Secure Record)** is used to demonstrate that a certain domain **does not exist**. An **NSEC record** lists the **next domain** in the DNS database, creating an ordered chain of records. If an attacker queries a non-existent domain, the DNS server responds with an **NSEC record**, revealing the next valid domain in the zone. Continuing in this way, I might be able to trace the domain where the flag is located.

## 🔬 Vulnerability Analysis
### Potential Vulnerabilities
>- [x] DNSSEC NSEC Walking

# 🎯 Solution Path

## Exploitation Steps
### Initial setup
> The next step was to query the new domain obtained from the previous `dig` command (`10 challenge.zoney.eno.`). Once I did that, I continued iterating until I reached the final domain, thus enumerating all the domains.
>
>
### Exploitation
> The exploitation is literally the process described above. As we can see from the image, I was able to find `hereisthe1377flag.zoney.eno`, where the flag was contained in the `TXT` (Text) field of the domain. Another way to achieve all of this is by using **dnsrecon**, a tool used for reconnaissance and subdomain enumeration.
