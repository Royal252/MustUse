# 🔍 Initial Analysis

## First Steps
> Initially, the website appears as follows:
> 
> ![Site Presentation](/images/NullCon-Goa-HackIM-CTF-2025/Bfail/site_presentation.png "Site Presentation")
>
> While inspecting the code with `ChromeDevTools`, I found this:
> 
> ![Page Source](/images/NullCon-Goa-HackIM-CTF-2025/Bfail/source.png "Page Source")
> 
> Interesting, so by visiting `/source`, we will have the source code of the page:
> 
> ![Source Code](/images/NullCon-Goa-HackIM-CTF-2025/Bfail/source_code.png "Source Code")
> 
> As we can see, it leaks the password in bytes:
>- `\xec\x9f\xe0a\x978\xfc\xb6:T\xe2\xa0\xc9<\x9e\x1a\xa5\xfao\xb2\x15\x86\xe5$\x86Z\x1a\xd4\xca#\x15\xd2x\xa0\x0e0\xca\xbc\x89T\xc5V6\xf1\xa4\xa8S\x8a%I\xd8gI\x15\xe9\xe7$M\x15\xdc@\xa9\xa1@\x9c\xeee\xe0\xe0\xf76`
> 
>and the full password in hash:
>- `$2b$12$8bMrI6D9TMYXeMv8pq8RjemsZg.HekhkQUqLymBic/cRhiKRa3YPK`
>
> and honestly, this comment is also very interesting:
> 
> ```python
> # This is super strong! The password was generated quite securely. Here are the first 70 bytes, since you won't be able to brute-force the rest anyway...  
> 
> strongpw = bcrypt.hashpw(os.urandom(128),bcrypt.gensalt()) # >>> strongpw[:71]
> ```
> 
> As we can see, the leak is of the first 70 bytes of the password, while a total of 71 bytes are used. Let's proceed with the exploit.


## 🔬 Vulnerability Analysis
### Potential Vulnerabilities
>- [x] Partial Hash Exposure (bcrypt)

# 🎯 Solution Path

## Exploitation Steps
### Initial setup
>  The exploit was based on brute-forcing that remaining byte since `71-70=1`. That’s a total of `256` combinations (nothing too challenging for a brute force). Once completed, we have the full password, which we will obviously verify by converting it into a hash and comparing it with the previously obtained hash.
>
### Exploitation
> I wrote a Python script to do all of this, and then I executed it:
>
>```bash
> python exploit.py
> ```  
> I also sent the request directly to the server using `Http`, since a simple `GET` or `POST` returned `Method Not Allowed`. I then took the server's response, extracted the flag using a regex, and subsequently printed it.
>   
### Flag capture

# 🛠️ Exploitation Process
## Approach
>The exploit literally follows the procedure described above:
