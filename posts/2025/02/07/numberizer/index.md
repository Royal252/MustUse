> As we can see, it is written in `php`, and we need to calculate a negative sum in order to access the flag. The numbers entered must be numeric and have a maximum of 4 digits, as we can see from the checks.

## 🔬 Vulnerability Analysis
### Potential Vulnerabilities
>- [x] Integer Overflow

# 🎯 Solution Path

## Exploitation Steps
### Initial setup
> Here, once we understand that we can exploit an Integer Overflow, by exceeding the maximum number we will cause the overflow, resulting in a negative number.
>
### Exploitation
> The exploit consists in sending numbers like `9e99`, which is equivalent to `9^99`. Since the maximum number of digits allowed is 4, by exploiting the exponential notation, we can trigger the integer overflow.

> 
> And as a result, we obtain the flag.

### Flag capture

# 🛠️ Exploitation Process
## Approach
>The exploit follows the same procedure mentioned above and extracts the flag using a regex.
