# 🔍 Initial Analysis

## First Steps
> Initially, the website appears as follows:
> 
> ![Site Presentation](/images/NullCon-Goa-HackIM-CTF-2025/Paginator/site_presentation.png "Site Presentation")
>
> When I clicked on `show pages 2,10`, it showed me the rows from the database by setting the parameter `p=2,10`. Then, I decided to click the link to the source, which directed me to `/?source`:
> 
> ![Source Code](/images/NullCon-Goa-HackIM-CTF-2025/Paginator/source.png "Source Code")
> 
> I saved the source in the file `source.php`. As we can see, a QUERY is made that retrieves all the pages by setting a minimum and maximum ID based on the parameter `p` we pass. Let's move on to the exploitation.


## 🔬 Vulnerability Analysis
### Potential Vulnerabilities
>- [x] SQL Injection

# 🎯 Solution Path

## Exploitation Steps
### Initial setup
>As we can notice, there is a check on the minimum value, so when passing `/?p=1,10 OR 1=1`, I get `this post is not accessible`. Therefore, I need to bypass that check, perhaps by setting the minimum value to `2`, for example.
>
### Exploitation
> Indeed, the exploit payload is exactly as follows: `/?p=2,10 OR 1=1`. The query would then be: `SELECT * FROM pages WHERE id>= 2 AND id<= 10 OR 1=1` By setting the minimum value to 2, we bypass the check. Using `OR 1=1` ensures that the query returns all the pages, so the page with the flag will also be displayed.
>  
>  ![Flag Base64](/images/NullCon-Goa-HackIM-CTF-2025/Paginator/flag.png "Flag Base64")
>  
>  As we can see from the source, the flag is encoded in `base64`. So, using the terminal, I perform the decode and obtain the flag:
>  
>  ```bash
>  echo "RU5Pe1NRTDFfVzF0aF8wdVRfQzBtbTRfVzBya3NfU29tZUhvdyF9" | base64 -d
>  ```

### Flag capture

# 🛠️ Exploitation Process
## Approach
>The exploit sends the request with the SQL Injection payload as the `p` parameter, and then it extracts the flag in `base64` format using a regex and decodes it.
