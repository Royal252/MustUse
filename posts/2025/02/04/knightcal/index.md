# 🔍 Initial Analysis

## First Steps
> Initially, the website appears as follows:
> 
> ![Site Presentation](/images/KnightCTF-2025/KnightCal/site_presentation.png "Site Presentation")
> 
> by trying to enter something in the numeric input box and submitting, I get letters in the file name:
> 
> ![Submit Try](/images/KnightCTF-2025/KnightCal/step_1.png "Submit Try")
> 
> so, I assume it's about finding the correct combination to print the contents of the file `flag.txt`. 

# 🎯 Solution Path

## Exploitation Steps
### Initial setup
>   
> After understanding how it works, I moved on to the exploit, doing a bit of guessing on the letters to figure out which number corresponded to which letter.
>
### Exploitation
>   
> After a couple of attempts, I came up with this:
>   
>   ![Second Attempt](/images/KnightCTF-2025/KnightCal/step_2.png "Second Attempt")
>   
> continuing to experiment, I found the correct combination, `7195`, which allowed me to read the `flag.txt` file.
>
### Flag capture
>  
>   ![Manual Flag](/images/KnightCTF-2025/KnightCal/manual_flag.png "Manual Flag")

# 🛠️ Exploitation Process
## Approach
> The exploit is very simple: it's a POST request to the page where I pass the parameter expression=7195, which is the correct combination. Then, I extract the flag from the response text using bs4:
